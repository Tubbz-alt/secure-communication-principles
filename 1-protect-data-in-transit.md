# 1. Protect data in transit

## Is content protected against tampering and eavesdropping?

Communications will typically transit an untrusted network, such as the internet. An untrusted network is outside of your control, which means someone may be able to access (or modify) data transiting that network.

You can protect against tampering and eavesdropping by using a service that encrypts data as it travels between participants.

## Can participants confirm who they are communicating with?

Communications can inadvertently be sent to the wrong recipient. This could be as simple as mistyping the recipient's details, which on some open services could result in sending information outside your organisation. Alternatively, recipients can 'spoof' other identities (i.e. pretend to be somebody they are not) and trick users into communicating with them. As a trusted recipient, it's then simple to share links to malicious websites, or spread misinformation.

You should use a service that offers authentication of other users, which allows a recipient to confirm a sender's identity.
