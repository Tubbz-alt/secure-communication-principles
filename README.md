## Introduction

Modern technology provides a wealth of options for communicating in the workplace, which now includes voice, email, group messaging, and video.

This guidance contains a set of principles that can help all organisations make sound security decisions when selecting the products and services that provide secure communications. It is aimed at risk owners and security professionals who wish to assess communication technologies for their organisations, to help them achieve the right balance of **functionality**, **security** and **privacy**.

It is of particular relevance for those working in government and the public sector.
